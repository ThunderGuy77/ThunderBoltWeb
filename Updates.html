        <p>Welcome to the News page, which was previously known as the Updates page. Here all the updates to the site will be recorded.</p>  
        <ul><li>Fixed the favicons on main pages. Now they should appear with the new ThunderGuy77 logo instead of the outdated ThunderBoltWeb one. -05/19/2021<li>Wow, it's been a while since I've been here... Well, finally got around to it and updated the website with my new Logo (Yipee!) and I updated the "Games" page because the iFrames stoppedworking on Code.org for some reason. I will continue to refresh the whole website with the new look, because that is clrearly not finished (although it's close to being almost done). Thank you guys so much! -05/06/2021<li>Updated the "Stuff" page. Broke my arm. -01/09/2020<li>Hover color set darker; better connectivity -11/15/2019</li><li>The "Stuff" page was updated and a few bugs were fixed. More and better games will be released soon, and so will articles and bookmarklets! -11/14/2019<li>Bookmarklets were added and Teetzel Kart was updated. Added the link to a new website which was originally was meant for school but was expanded to adapt to the official ThunderBoltWeb system. -12/10/2019<li>All seven main pages have been updated with the new and improved website format thanks to w3schools! Also, I will try to update the News page more often! -8/05/2020<li>GeoBlox Tower Defense 3 is being developed. Also, I've reached 200 subscribers! Thanks! Check me out on Reddit too. Sorry I've been pretty inactive on this website recently, I've just had a lot going on at school. I will graduate in 2023, though, so yeah. :P -11/16/2021</ul> 
        <h2>Looking Into the Future</h2>
        <p><i>Coming Soon: </i>Updated webpages, new articles, more videos, quality content, and GeoBlox Tower Defense 3?! I'll finish updating sub-pages soon, I promise! ;) Check out my YouTube channel for more!</p>
