    <h1>About ThunderGuy77</h1>
    <p>Well, for privacy reasons, I can't exactly tell you exactly who I am, haha. But I can give you some general information about the existance of yours truly. I am smart, unlike some people. No offense, friends of mine. Heh heh. >:)</p>
    <ul><li>Thunderguy77 is a human being</li>
      <li>Thunderguy77 is alive</li>
      <li>Thunderguy77 made this website</li>
      <li>Thunderguy77's nickname is Thunderguy77</li></ul>
    <p>What? You don't like this information? Well, sorry, but I am not exactly able to give you my social security number, bruh! Don't you think I get enough fake calls from fraudulent numbers trying to steal my identity? (And, by the way, did you know that if you receive a call from the social security office, it's fake? This department will never call you - they actually only send their messages through the mail, to keep your information confidential. So don't answer their calls!) But fine: here, I'll give you some more information about me, salty.</p>
    <ul><li>ThunderGuy77 is in high school.</li>
      <li>ThunderGuy77 plans to be a computer programmer.</li>
      <li>ThunderGuy77 has made a lot of games and has even gotten featured on popular apps several times.</li>
      <li>I am a normal person, meaning I enjoy video games.</li>
      <li>I make videos as well (See "Stuff").</li>
      <li>I love music too! Especially rap, though my playlist is clean. Go to "Music" to download tunes!</li>
      <li>I make games too.</li>

    <h2>Game Favorites</h2>
    <p>I am a gamer. But I don't play all those pointless gun games. Literally every gun game feels like the same thing. So I try more strategy, building, and adventure games. Below are a few of my favorites.</p>
    <ul><li>Minecraft</li>
      <li>Spider-Man</li>
      <li>Mario Kart</li>
      <li>And More!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I also like music I lot! I like to keep my music diverse. That's why a lot of different people, though they might not like all of my music, they like at least some of the songs that I have. Enjoy this FREE music!</p>
    <p>All of the music in this playlist is clean. The list is updated according to new songs in my playlist when the full site is updated.</p>
